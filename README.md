Feature flags allow you to toggle functionality in both Django code and the Django templates based on configurable conditions. Flags can be useful for staging feature deployments, for A/B testing, or for any time you need an on/off switch for blocks of code. The toggle can be by date, user, URL value, or a number of [other conditions](https://cfpb.github.io/django-flags/conditions/), editable in the admin or in definable in settings.
